# python-challenge
This is the repository for the Module 3 (learning python) challenge for the CWRU Data Visualization Bootcamp.

In this repository are two separate folders for two separate parts of the challenge

The first part of the challenge is in the folder "PyBank". This challenge was to analyze budget data from a csv and calculate specified values such as the changes in monthly profits.

The second part of the challenge is in the folder "PyPoll". This challenge was to analyze election data from a csv and calculate the number of votes each candidate received, as well as determining the winner of the election.

There is a separate python script for each folder and each script exports a text file with the pre-specified values asked for in the challenge instructions to a folder named "analysis".

To run the script in the PyBank folder, one should change directories to be in the PyBank folder within the python-challenge folder (~/python-challenge/PyBank), rather than running it from the python-challenge folder.

Similarly, to run the script in the PyPoll folder, one should change directories from the python-challenge folder to the PyPoll folder (~/python-challenge/PyPoll).
